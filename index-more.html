  <p>Our society comprises members of the International Biometric Society
  <a href="http://www.BiometricSociety.org"> (IBS)</a> 
  that predominantly reside in Australia and New Zealand. Currently, membership numbers are over 200.</p>
  
  <p>Professionally, we are statisticians, biometricians,
  mathematicians, scientists and managers, from academia, consulting or
  research and development, with biological applications being the common link.
  Biological applications include medicine, public health, ecology,
  environmental science, agriculture, genetics, microbiology and toxicology,
  amongst others.</p>
  
  <p>Our employers range from local and commonwealth government agencies
  where there may be a team of biometricians employed, to private institutions
  which may only employ one biometrician.</p>
  
  <p>We offer student scholarships and financial support to attend conferences on a regular basis.  
  See our <a href="prizes.html">Prizes/Awards</a> page.</p>
  
<p>Our main activity is our regional biennial conference. Our last one in 2019 was 
<a href="https://ausbiometric2019.org/">Biometrics by the Botanic Gardens,</a>
 in Adelaide, SA, and you can read about it and previous 
 <a href="conferences.html">regional conferences here</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <!--<p>If you have not already, book the first week in December 2019 for coming to 
 <a href="https://southaustralia.com/places-to-go/adelaide">Adelaide, South Australia</a> to attend the next
<a href="https://ausbiometric2019.org/">Australasian regional meeting during 1-6 December 2019</a>.
 Seven workshops on a range of topics will be presented on either Sunday or Monday, 1-2 December, with the main conference running from Tuesday to Friday lunchtime. </p>
 -->
<p>And put aside the end of November/beginning of December 2021 for our next regional conference, in sunny Northland, New Zealand.
 As always, attuned to the interests of the regional membership, the conference will look at statistics research and applications in medicine and public health,
 agriculture and environment, genetics, natural sciences and education. Feel free to suggest local or overseas invited speakers. For that and any other enquiries, please contact
our current regional<a href="mailto:alan.welsh@anu.edu.au?subject=Regional%20Biometric%20Society%20query"> President, Alan Welsh</a>. </p>

 The last regional conference of the Australasian Region, titled “Biometrics by the Border”, was held in 2017 the
<a href="http://www.mantra.com.au/new-south-wales/tweed-coast/kingscliff/accommodation/resorts/mantra-on-salt-beach/conferences"> Mantra on Salt Beach</a>, Kingscliff, which is located south of Queensland's Gold Coast, just across the border into NSW. The dates of the conference were 26-30 November 2017.</p>
<p>For keynote speakers the all-female line-up celebrated achievements by women in the field of biometrics. Professors Elisabetta Carfagna (University of Bologna, Italy), Di Cook (Monash University), Rachel Fewster (University of Auckland), Sonja Greven (LM University Munich, Germany), Louise Ryan (University of Technology Sydney), and Jean Yang (University of Sydney) shared their latest insights in their respective fields, and in some cases also gave weekend workshops before the conference proper. Louise, as President-elect of IBS closed the conference, and it was current President Elizabeth Thompson who opened the conference. As well as the six keynote talks there were 66 contributed talks.</p>
<p>The region's biennial general meeting (BGM) was also held during the conference. Ian Renner was elected to a newly created position, that of Membership Officer. Ross Darnell's one-year 2017 term as Past President was noted as almost over. Alan Welsh was elected as President for 2019-2020, serving as President-Elect in 2018. All other positions had incumbents returned unopposed.</p>
<p>At the conference dinner on Wednesday night the region recognised members who have given "longtime" service to our Society and to the advancement of biometry. The 2017 <a href="alf.html">ALF </a>awardees, 
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/australasian-biometrics/27015881629/in/album-72157689141157351">Alan Welsh and Warren Muller, were both present to receive their awards in person</a>.</p>

<p> Recent posts, with many photographs, to our own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ibs.dash.ar">Facebook group, IBS-AR</a> (which we invite all members to join), give the flavour of what was another great regional conference. The full set of photographs is on
