<p><FONT COLOR="red">IBS-AR Scholarships for Honours and coursework Masters students 2023</FONT> </p>

<p>The Australasian Region of the International Biometric Society wants to attract enthusiastic and talented graduates or near graduates 
to career paths in biostatistics and biometrics. Therefore, we  offer scholarships for suitably qualified students who intend to undertake 
a fourth or honours year of study or a Master’s degree in statistics, mathematical statistics, biostatistics, bioinformatics or biometrics 
at an Australian or New Zealand university. Further details are <a href="http://biometricsociety.org.au/studentprizes.html">here. </a>
This year’s application deadline is Friday 10 March. </p>
<p>Last year the IBS-AR council congratulated both <b>Sophie Giraudo</b> and <b>Viktor Tsang</b> for winning 
IBS-AR student scholarships in 2022. Sophie was an Honours student at the University of Western Australia, Perth, and Victor was an Honours student
at the University of NSW, Sydney. Read all about them in the <a href="newsletters/IBS-AR-Newsletter-May-2022.pdf">May 2022 Newsletter</a>.</p>

<!--
<p>The IBS-AR council would like to congratulate both <b>Vicky He</b> and <b>Kieren Brodnik</b> for winning IBS-AR student scholarships in 2021.</p>
<p><b>Vicky He</b> is at the University of Otago in Dunedin. She was passionate about science at school and first chose psychology as her major at university.
 But seeing statistics would help with research in psychology, added statistics as a major as well, 
 and is now studying towards an Honours degree in statistics. However, she still likes psychology and neuroscience 
 and so her Honours project is about analysing neuroimaging data, with a focus on diffusion tensor imaging,
 under primary supervision of Dr. Matthew Schofield.</p>
<p><b>Kieren Brodnik</b> is currently undergoing his Honours degree in Mathematics at the University of Wollongong
 with the Centre of Bioinformatics and Biometrics (CBB) under the supervision of Professor Brian Cullis. 
 He has a mathematics BSc with a double major in Mathematics and Statistics. 
 He completed a Summer internship program with CBB which gave him a strong interest
 in the field of biostatistics and led to the the Honours degree with CBB. </p>

<p><FONT COLOR="red">A sad message from Alan Welsh, our regional President:</FONT> </p> 
<p>Sue Wilson, Past-President and Honorary Life Member of the International Biometric Society (IBS) passed away yesterday at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney.
This is very sad news for her family, for all of us and for IBS. Sue had cancer for some time but the end felt very sudden as she was around at seminars a week or so ago.
I believe that Sue's Sydney family is currently thinking of a very small family funeral soon with a memorial service for the wider community who worked with and knew Sue well to follow later.
