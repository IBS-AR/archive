<h2>Purpose<a id="purpose"></a></h2>

<p>
The International Biometric Society (TIBS) is devoted to the development
and application of statistical and mathematical theory and methods in
the Biosciences, including agriculture, biomedical science and public
health, ecology, environmental sciences, forestry, and allied
disciplines. It welcomes as members statisticians, mathematicians,
biological scientists, and others devoted to interdisciplinary efforts
in advancing the collection and interpretation of information in the
biosciences. </p>

<p>The Society publishes two journals, Biometrics, reporting
communications consistent with the Society's mission, and, jointly with
the American Statistical Association, the Journal of Agricultural,
Biological, and Environmental Statistics. 
</p>

<p>
TIBS is organised into
geographically-defined regions, each with at least 50 members. 
The Australasian Region is one of 19 regions under the TIBS umbrella that
provides members of The International Biometric Society who
predominantly reside in Australia and New Zealand, a local focus and
support for biometrics undertaken in this region.
</p>

<h2>History<a id="history"></a></h2>

<p>
History is still being written! We plan on providing information about
the formation of the region, who the office bearers have been over the
years, and links to important historical documents and events. Check
back shortly for an update to this.
</p>

<h2>Our members<a id="members"></a></h2>

<p>
In 2006 there were 179 financial members of the Australasian Region.
Almost three-quarters of our members reside in Australia, with more than
half of these from the states of Queensland and New South Wales. The
other quarter of our members are mostly from New Zealand, although we
also have members that reside in England, USA, China, Germany and
Thailand.</p>

<p>
Majority of members are regular members and small proportions are
associate, student or supporting members.
