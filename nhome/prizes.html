<div class="text">
	<p>Our society offers scholarships and travel awards
on a regular basis to student and/or early career members of the
society. Details of these follow.</p>

<h2> Honours scholarships </h2>

<p>The society wants to attract
enthusiastic and talented graduates, or near graduates, in statistics,
mathematical statistics, biostatistics, bioinformatics or biometrics, to
career paths in biostatistics and biometrics. As such we offer
scholarships for suitably qualified students who intend to undertake a
full-time fourth or honours year of study in statistics, mathematical
statistics, biostatistics, bioinformatics or biometrics.</p>

<p>
Scholarships are for one year and are valued at AUD$1000. Applicants
should be completing, or have recently completed, a third year of a
relevant bachelors degree course, or equivalent, with majors in
statistics, mathematical statistics, biostatistics, bioinformatics or
biometrics, and must have a strong academic record, potential for a
career in research, a strong interest in applications of mathematics and
statistics to the biosciences, and good communication skills.</p>

<p>
They are usually advertised in September on national mailing lists, with
relevant material and criteria available on the regional website.
Applications are due during November with successful candidates being
notified by Christmas.</p>

<h2> Travel grants</h2>
<p>Occasionally we offer travel awards to
assist outstanding students or early career researchers resident in the
Australasian region who are interested in attending regional or
international meetings but need financial support. A condition of the
award is the requirement to present a talk at the meeting of interest.</p>

<p>
The value of these awards varies and depends on the conference and the
number of awards on offer.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2> Other scholarships</h2>
	<p> Other scholarships and awards of relevance to our members will be listed here when details are available.</p>
