<div class="text">
	<p>A biennial meeting is one of the main activities of the region, which
enables members and non-members to come together to exchange ideas,
learn about new research methodologies and applications, network and
potentially establish important contacts and collaboration
opportunities. These conferences are renowned for being intimate
regarding numbers of participants, yet large enough to facilitate
invited and contributed presentations as well as poster presentations.
The program typically runs over several days with an optional social
activity afternoon organised half-way to encourage further social and
professional networking.</p>

<p>The next regional meeting - Biometrics by the Beach - will be held in
Coffs Harbour on 2-6 December 2007. The website for this conference is
still being developed but a link to this conference will be provided in
the very near future.</p>

<p>If you are interested in details of past regional meetings such as where
and when they have been held, numbers of participants, etc., then take a
look <a href="PastConferences.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>A number of our members also recommend attending the biennial
International Biometric Conference (IBC) meetings, which are held in the
off-year to our regional meetings. The next IBC will be held in Dublin
in July 2008. See IBC 2008 for further details.</p>

<p>Other conferences of relevance to regional biometricians will be
announced here as information comes to hand. If you have a conference of
relevance to the biometrical community in Australia or New Zealand, then
please contact the <a href="mailto:webmaster@biometrics.org.au">Website Manager </a> with details.</p>
