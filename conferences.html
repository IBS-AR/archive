student awards for talks</a>

<p> In the general category <a href="https://samrogers.website">Sam Rogers</a> was judged to have the best poster and Alan Welsh received honourable mention.</p>
--> 
<p>A biennial meeting is one of the main activities of the region, which enables members and non-members to come together to exchange ideas,
 learn about new research methodologies and applications, network and establish important contacts and collaboration opportunities.
 These five-day conferences are renowned for being intimate regarding numbers of participants,
 yet large enough to facilitate worthwhile invited and contributed talks as well as poster presentations.
 The program typically has a reception gathering, a poster event, an excursion afternoon and an evening conference dinner,
 all to encourage social and professional networking. Specialist pre-conference short-courses on the first day are also a feature
 for those interested or wanting professional development.</p>

<h2><a href="conferences/Hobart2015/index.html">Biometrics by the Harbour - 2015<a> </h2>

<p>Hobart, Tasmania, Sunday 29th November - Thursday 3rd December 2015 was the place and period of our 2015 regional conference, <a href="conferences/Hobart2015/index.html">Biometrics by the Harbour!<a> 
</p>
<p>
The 2015 conference was held at one of Hobart's oldest hotels - <a href="http://hadleyshotel.com.au">Hadley's Orient Hotel</a> - located in the heart of Hobart.  Hobart itself is well known for its history, its natural beauty, its food and culture, and as a gateway to Tasmania's pristine wilderness. We enjoyed a world-class conference in a stimulating environment.</p>

<p>
Note for the future that the IBS Awards Fund Committee has a program to assist IBS members from developing countries to attend conferences sponsored by IBS Regions or Networks, such as Biometrics by the Harbour. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.biometricsociety.org/travel-grant-application">www.biometricsociety.org/travel-grant-application/</a>.</p>
