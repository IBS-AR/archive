<h1>Student prizes and awards</h1>
<!--<b>UPDATE:</b> Applications for a travel award to <a href="http://biometricconference.org/">International Biometric Conference</a> (IBC) in Victoria, Canada, during 10-15 July 2016 are now open, using the <a href="docs/IBC 2016 travel grant.doc">form</a> as seen below. --> 

<p>Our society offers scholarships and travel awards on a regular basis to students and/or early career members of the society. The value of these scholarships and awards are set by regional council and may be reviewed annually.</p>

<h2>Scholarships for Honours and coursework Masters students</h2>
<p>The Australasian Region of the International Biometric Society wants to attract enthusiastic and talented graduates, or near graduates to career paths in biostatistics and biometrics. Therefore the society offers scholarships for suitably qualified students who intend to undertake a fourth or honours year of study, or a coursework Masters, in statistics, mathematical statistics, biostatistics, bioinformatics or biometrics.</p>

<p>Scholarships are for one year. Applicants should have completed a third year of a relevant bachelors degree course, or equivalent, with a major in statistics, mathematical statistics, biostatistics, bioinformatics or biometrics, and must have a strong academic record, potential for a career in research, a strong interest in applications of mathematics and statistics to the biosciences, and good communication skills.</p>

<p>The closing date for applications in 2023 was Friday 10th March, with a call for applications made in February. Please read the <a href="docs/IBS-AR-Scholarships2023-information.doc">More Information</a> document carefully to verify your eligibility before submitting an application.

<h2>Travel grants</h2>
<p>The Australasian Region of the International Biometric Society wants to encourage enthusiastic and talented research students and recent graduates in statistics, mathematical statistics, biostatistics, bioinformatics or biometrics, to career paths in biostatistics and biometrics. Consequently, occasionally the region offers a travel award to assist an outstanding student member of the society or an early career regular member, resident in the region, who intend to present a talk or poster at relevant regional or international meetings but need financial support.</p>
<p>The value of these awards varies and depends on the conference and the number of awards on offer.</p>


<!--
<h2>IBC 2018 travel award</h2>
<p>The region also offers a travel award to assist a student member of the society or an early career regular member who intends to present a talk or poster at the biennial International Biometric Conferences.</p>

<p> Currently a travel grant is available for the next <a href="http://2018.biometricconference.org">International Biometric Conference</a> to be held in Barcelona, Spain, from Sunday 8th to Friday 13th July 2018.</p>
<p>For this award, ‘early career’ is anyone who obtained their most recent relevant degree in the last 5 years.
The award will be up to AUD $3000, depending on previous length of membership. All applicants should already be a member of the society; those joining the IBS-AR after 6th December 2018 may only qualify for a reduced award.</p>

<p>Note that abstract submission for the IBC closes on the 10th January 2018 at <a href="https://ibc2018.abstractcentral.com">ibc2018.abstractcentral.com</a>.
Applicants should have a paper or poster submitted to the conference, and include their abstract in their application.
Please note that the closing date for applications is Friday 2 March 2018. Further information on how to apply can be found <a href="docs/IBC 2018 travel grant.pdf">here</a>.</p>
