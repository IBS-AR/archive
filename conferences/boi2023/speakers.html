<h2>Keynote speakers</h2>
  <h3><span>Lisa Warbrick (Ng&amacr;ti Awa, Ng&amacr;ti Rangitihi, Te Atihaunui a P&amacr;p&amacr;rangi)&mdash;Te P&umacr; Oranga Whenua, NZ</span></h3>
  <img src="img/lisaw.jpg"  height="172" alt="Lisa Warbrick" title="" class="speaker"></img>
  <p>Lisa is Director for the Indigenous Genomics Institute (IGI) and Pou Arataki for Te P&umacr; Oranga Whenua (TPOW), a national collective of M&amacr;ori Agribusinesses with w&amacr;hine leadership.  With over 25 years' experience in M&amacr;ori economic 
  development and Kaupapa M&amacr;ori, whanau wellbeing is at the heart of Lisa's 25 years management, community and enterprise experience.  Lisa's leadership roles with the IGI and TPOW have had her working at the interface between M&amacr;tauranga M&amacr;ori and western eResearch data infrastructure, governance and ethics as New Zealand and the world grapples with what sovereignty of data looks like in practice. 
  She will share her broad, practical experiences with understanding what makes data tika (accurate, fair) not just from government, research and industry perspective, but from a grass-roots M&amacr;oridom point of view 
  (te ao M&amacr;ori).</p>

  <h3><span>Poppy Miller&mdash;Plant and Food Research Ltd., NZ</span></h3>
  <img src="img/poppym.jpg"  height="172" alt="Poppy Miller" title="" class="speaker"></img>
  <p>
  Poppy has been working as a statistical scientist since 2018. Prior to this she was developing statistical models for zoonotic disease 
  applications as part of her PhD at Lancaster University, UK. She is currently based at Plant and Food Research in Te Puke, 
  New Zealand and works on a variety of applied statistical projects including applications in plant breeding, fish farming, 
  genomic selection and live shellfish storage.<br><br> 
 
 Poppy is passionate about applied statistics and statistical consulting because these provide ample opportunity to “play in everyone's backyard”. 
 She also enjoys the reverse, empowering scientists to more confidently understand and use statistics in their work. Poppy has expertise in 
 experimental design, statistical model design (especially Bayesian), spatial statistics, and statistical genetics. She enjoys the problem 
 solving involved in understanding the relevant biological system, designing a (usually constrained!) experiment, developing a 
 suitable statistical model and creating visualisations. She makes extensive use of modern reproducible workflows to optimise the process of 
 designing, using and communicating statistical analyses with her colleagues and collaborators. Poppy's presentation will give you a peek into the 
 life of a statistical scientist by delving into an unexpectedly challenging project.

  <h3><span>Joanne Potts&mdash;The Analytical Edge, AU</span></h3>
  <img src="img/joannep.jpg"  height="172" alt="Joanne Potts" title="" class="speaker"></img>
 <p>
  Since 2012, Joanne has run her own statistical consulting firm, The Analytical Edge Pty. Ltd., based in southern Tasmania. During this time, she has worked on a variety of nationally and internationally 
  funded projects for state and federal government agencies, NGOs, private industry and academic researchers, advising on optimal survey design for data collection and ensuring management actions are guided 
  by statistically robust analyses and results.  The diversity of her role is vast, having worked on projects assessing impacts on endangered species from development and changing fire regimes; through to 
  mapping and predicting disease spread; assessing risk of component failure in manufacturing, and ensuring women are provided effective pain relief during labour. Joanne is passionate about extending statistical 
  capabilities for people who wouldn't call themselves statisticians but use statistical methods in their work, and provides training to researchers and industry consultants to ensure they are using best-practice 
  methods for analysing their data. More recently, Joanne works in fisheries throughout the Pacific, concentrating on describing the impacts of climate change on commercially harvested fish and bycatch species.<br><br>  
 
    Joanne's presentation will cover her lessons learned working as a statistical consultant. She will reflect on running a small business whilst juggling the needs of family 
    (and herself!) and share some of the highs and lows of working in this area.

  <h3><span>Hans-Pieter Piepho&mdash;University of Hohenheim, DE.</span></h3>
    <img src="img/hanspeterp.jpg"  height="172" alt="Hans-Peter Piepho" title="" class="speaker"></img>
    <p>
      Hans-Peter Piepho was appointed Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany in 2001. He has 
    been working as an applied statistician in agricultural research for more than 30 years. His main interests are related to statistical procedures as 
    needed in plant genetics, plant breeding and cultivar testing. Recent interests include envirotype- and marker-enabled breeding, spatial methods for 
    field trials and experimental design for various applications including two-phase experiments and multi-environment trials. Further areas of interest include network 
    meta-analysis and measure of goodness of fit for generalized linear mixed models.

  <h3><span>David Warton&mdash;University of New South Wales, AU.</span></h3>
    <img src="img/davidw.jpg"  height="172" alt="David Warton" title="" class="speaker"></img>
    <p>
      David trained to postgraduate level in both statistics and ecology, and his research continues to be at the interface between these disciplines. 
    He has been influential in modernising approaches used in ecology to analyse allometric, multivariate and presence-only data.  
    He advocates a model-based approach where we identify the key properties of data and develop a statistical model to capture these properties, an approach which 
    sometimes necessitates the development of new methodology.  He recently wrote a text for ecologists on this theme, published through Springer.  
    David is a Statistics Professor at UNSW Sydney, where he co-founded Stats Central, the university's first statistical consulting unit, which now has nine staff.  
    He also co-founded the Statistical Consulting Network, which has active members across Australia and New Zealand.</p>
  <p>David's research has been honoured with awards from the Australian Academy of Science, the American Statistical Association, 
    and the Royal Society of New South Wales.  He is currently interested in developing fast tools for large spatial and spatio-temporal datasets, to better 
    understand ecological communities using presence-only data.
