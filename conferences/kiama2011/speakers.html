                 <h1>Invited Speakers</h1>     
<p>A brief biography of each of the invited speakers presenting a plenary session at the Biometrics by the Blowholes conference appears below.</p>
 <h2>David Balding</h2>           
 <p>
    <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ugi/research/DavidBalding">David Balding</a> was born in Kiama and educated at the Kiama Catholic primary school, Chevalier College Bowral and Kiama High School.  
He achieved a B. Math. with 1st class hons and University Medal at Newcastle, NSW, worked there for a further year as a research assistant and tutor, then took up a Commonwealth Scholarship to study 
for a PhD in mathematics at the University of Oxford, UK. 
He then held a junior academic post at Oxford for a year before moving successively to Queen Mary London, the University of Reading, and Imperial College London. 
</p>
<p>

Since October 2009, he has been Professor of Statistical Genetics at the Institute of Genetics, University College London. 
David researches a broad range of mathematical and statistical problems in genetics - evolutionary, population, medical, forensic and, most recently, crop. 
Much of his statistical genetics work involves computer-intensive stochastic algorithms, and is usually within the Bayesian paradigm of statistical inference. 
His early work on methods of analysis for the interpretation of forensic DNA profiles was summarized in his monograph Weight-of-Evidence for Forensic DNA Profiles (Wiley, 2005), 

and he is a member of the External Advisory Group of the UK Forensic Science Service. </p>
<p>

David was lead editor of the Handbook of Statistical Genetics (Wiley, 3rd ed 2007). 
He is a Fellow of both the Royal Statistical Society and the Society of Biology. He was (2006-08) President of the British and Irish Region of the IBS.

                          <h2>David Clayton</h2>           
 <p>
    <a href="http://www.cimr.cam.ac.uk/investigators/clayton/profile.php">David Clayton</a>
 
was introduced to biostatistics, in 1968,  when working as a computer
programmer in Professor Peter Armitage's department at the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He later transferred to
Professor Jerry Morris's MRC Social Medicine at LSHTM, where his
lifetime interest in epidemiology began, first in cardiovascular
disease, and later in cancer, perinatology and, finally, in genetic
epidemiology.
</p><p>

While holding a teaching post at Leicester University, in 1985 he spent a
sabbatical period in Nick Day's group at the International Agency for
Research in Cancer in Lyon, France. Although very brief, this had a major
impact on his later career, leading to involvement in many
international instructional courses, and collaborative research work 
with Nick Day, Norman Breslow, and others. After Nick moved to Cambridge to
take over the MRC Biostatistics Unit, he joined him in 1990. Shortly
after this he developed an interest in genetic epidemiology, then in
its early stages of development in Cambridge. This took up an
increasing proportion of his time throughout the 1990's, and in 2000 he finally
moved to the Cambridge University Department of Medical Genetics,
where he holds a Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellowship. 
</p><p>
During
this period, David has worked on the genetic epidemiology of
autoimmunity, hypertension, and age-related macular degeneration, and
has been much involved with methodological developments, particularly
of genome-wide association studies.

He has co-authored more than 140 refereed papers. Much research involves the application and development of 
linear mixed models techniques. He is a member of the ASReml project team, which is now used in over 35 countries with more than 1500 citations. 
He is a past Co-Editor of Biometrics and currently is an Associate Editor of the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics and the Journal of Agricultural Science Cambridge.
