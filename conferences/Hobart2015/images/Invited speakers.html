<p>This talk aims to reflect a little on the languages we use to explain, discuss and communicate statistical concepts, models and analysis, both within our own community and beyond it. There will be particular emphasis on how we communicate uncertainty. Several types of analysis will be considered, mostly involving flexible regression and focussed largely on different forms of spatiotemporal data. However, there will be a strong focus on the role of graphics, which can provide a powerful means of conceptual communication and give clear expressions of the insights provided by models, while remaining true to the issues associated with uncertainty. </p>

<p> Mixture models have now become an important tool in statistical modelling, with the EM algorithm being an important driver in their popularization and applicability. This talk will present the basic ideas and discuss a range of different mixture models and their use in addressing specific applied problems. Examples discussed will include: mixtures of non-linear regression models for fish growth studies; mixtures of smooth curves for clustering time-course microarray data; mixture orthogonal regression models for sugarcane SNP data; regression mixture models for outlier detection/accommodation. </p>

<h3 style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="4"> Estimating Abundance from Counts in Large Data Sets of Irregularly Spaced Plots using Spatial Basis Functions  </font></h3>
<p> Monitoring plant and animal populations is an important goal for both academic research and management of natural resources. Successful management of populations often depends on obtaining estimates of their mean or total over a region. The basic problem considered in this paper is the estimation of a total from a sample of plots containing count data, but the plot placements are spatially irregular and non-randomized. Our application had counts from thousands of irregularly spaced aerial photo images. We used change-of-support methods to model counts in images as a realization of an inhomogeneous Poisson process that used spatial basis functions to model the spatial intensity surface. The method was very fast and took only a few seconds for thousands of images. The fitted intensity surface was integrated to provide an estimate from all unsampled areas, which is added to the observed counts. The proposed method also provides a finite area correction factor to variance estimation. The intensity surface from an inhomogeneous Poisson process tends to be too smooth for locally clustered points, typical of animal distributions, so we introduce several new overdispersion estimators due to poor performance of the classic one. We used simulated data to examine estimation bias and to investigate several variance estimators with overdispersion. A real example is given of harbor seal counts from aerial surveys in an Alaskan glacial fjord. 

Bio: Jay Ver Hoef a statistician for the National Marine Mammal Lab of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA), U.S. Dept. of Commerce. He obtained a Ph.D. at Iowa State University in Statistics in 1991. Jay develops statistical methods and consults on a wide variety of topics related to marine mammals and stream networks. The Marine Mammal Lab is located in Seattle, Washington, although Jay lives in Fairbanks, Alaska.  His main statistical interests are in spatial statistics and Bayesian statistics, especially applied to ecological and environmental data.  Jay is a fellow of the American Statistical Association.

<h3 style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="4">The case of the missing model: the modernisation of multivariate analysis in ecology </font></h3>
<p> For the best part of four decades, multivariate analysis in ecology has diverged substantially from mainstream statistics, perhaps because state-of-the-art in 1980's statistics was not capable of handling the complexity frequently seen in multivariate abundance data simultaneously collected across many species. But the methods developed in the ecological literature, still widely used today, have some serious shortcomings that suggest they are fast approaching their use-by date. The statistical literature appears to be "catching up" with ecology, in part through technologies to fit quite flexible hierarchical models capable of accommodating key date structure.  There is a significant movement now to reunify multivariate analysis in ecology with modern statistical practices. Some key developments on this front will be reviewed, and immediate challenges identified.

Bio: David trained jointly between ecology and statistics to postgraduate level (at Sydney and Macquarie), and his research since then has been at the interface of these two disciplines, addressing what he considers to be a significant knowledge gap.  He has organised the Eco-Stats conference (this December at UNSW), and its previous iteration in 2013, to help create connections across these disciplines.  His research ranges from applied to theoretical - translating modern statistical tools to ecology, and developing new statistical methodology motivated by ecological problems, including contributions to high-dimensional data analysis, resampling, point process modelling and model selection.
