<p>For those pre-conference and/or conference delegates who will be in Perth on Saturday 30 November 2013, I am planning a special  
 <a href="images/first.pizza.png">pizza</a>
 night at my home (6pm-10pm). The evening will also involve other foods cooked in the pizza oven as well as master class demonstrations of pizza making! 
</p>
<p>The evening WILL BE DRY i.e. no alcoholic drinks allowed on the premises! This is so that delegates attending the pre-conference short courses the next day will be focussed, as well as course presenters and members of the committees need to also prepare for the next day's registration and meetings. There will be ample opportunities to sample the local wine and beer at the conference! See the social programme.
</p>
<p>Please note:</p>
<p>1. Filtered water and soft drinks/juices will be available as well as hot beverages such as tea, hot chocolate, cafe latte or espressos on the night.</p>
<p>2. We will be organising transport to The Sebel Hotel Mandurah (TSMH)/other accommodation venues in Mandurah during the night (at least 2 trips, at 7pm and then 9:30pm). Some delegates will be arriving early in the afternoon after long journeys and have already indicated they would like transport to Mandurah by 7pm.</p>

 <p>3. At this stage there is expected to be no charge for delegates registered for a short course on Sunday 1 December 2013, LOC and SPC committee members, Invited speakers and Showcase speakers. There may be a small fee for delegates not in the above category, and/or partners of delegates. No decision will be made until we close registrations on Monday 18 November 2013. Please indicate on your registration form if you will be in Perth on Saturday 30 November 2013.</p>

<p>4. If you are planning to fly into Perth on Saturday 30 November 2013 afternoon, then I recommend you come to my place (taxi or special bus leaving at 4:30pm), rather than going to Mandurah and then coming back to my place. (My place is about 20 kilometres south-west of the Perth Domestic Airport and then you need to go about 60 kilometres south to The Sebel Mandurah Hotel). The registration form includes room to advise your flight details on Saturday afternoon. Delegates will be advised of final details of event and bus location by email after registrations close.</p>
<p>If you have any queries, please <a href="mailto:LOC@BiometricSociety.org.au">email me.</a></p>
 
 <p>Mario, Chair, Local organising committee, Mandurah 2013.</p>
