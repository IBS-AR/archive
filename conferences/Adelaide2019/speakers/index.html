<h4 id="massey-university-new-zealand">Massey University, New Zealand</h4>
<p>Distinguished Professor Marti J. Anderson is an ecological statistician whose work spans several disciplines, from ecology to mathematical statistics. A Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand, and a recent recipient of a prestigious James Cook Fellowship, she holds the Professorial Chair in Statistics in the New Zealand Institute for Advanced Study (NZIAS) at Massey University in Auckland. Her core research is in community ecology, biodiversity, multivariate analysis, models of ecological count data, experimental design and resampling methods, with a special focus on creating new applied statistics for ecology that can yield new insights into global patterns of biodiversity. Marti is also the Director of PRIMER-e (Quest Researcher Limited), a boutique research and software development company that creates user-friendly software (PRIMER and PERMANOVA+) to implement robust multivariate statistical methods for ecological analysis and synthesis.</p>

<h4 id="wageningen-university-netherlands">Wageningen University, Netherlands</h4>
<p>Daniela Bustos-Korts works as a researcher at Biometris, Wageningen University (NL). She graduated with a BSc in Agriculture and an MSc in Crop Physiology from the Universidad Austral de Chile. In 2017, she obtained her PhD from Wageningen University. Her PhD thesis was about the use of statistical and crop growth models for phenotype prediction across multiple environments. Her research interests are in the development of strategies that combine statistical and crop growth models to help breeders designing effective phenotyping and prediction schemes that will help them improving response to selection. These strategies involve the use of crop growth models like APSIM and linear mixed models for multi-trait and multi-environment genomic prediction.</p>

<p><img src="/img/speakers/Czado.jpg#responsive-speaker" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="technical-university-of-munich-germany">Technical University of Munich, Germany</h4>
<p>The research activities of Professor Claudia Czado are in statistics. Her special interests lie in the modeling of complex dependencies including regression effects and time/space structures.  For this she uses a copula approach and especially the flexible class of <a href="www.vine-copula.org">vine copulas</a>. This allows for different non-symmetric dependencies for pairs of variables. For model selection and estimation in high dimensions computer-aided methods are developed. Applications are in finance, insurance and engineering.</p>
<p>After studying mathematics in Göttingen, Germany, Professor Claudia Czado obtained her doctorate in 1989 at Cornell University, USA,  in Operations Research and Industrial Engineering. She then became an Assistant Professor and 1995 Associate Professor of Statistics at York University, Toronto, Canada. In 1998 she was appointed to the Technical University of Munich, Germany,  in the field of Applied Mathematical Statistics. Professor Claudia Czado is the author or co-author of more than 120 publications. She is also co-founder/coordinator of the junior research program &ldquo;Global Challenges for Women in Math Science&rdquo; at the Technical University of Munich.</p>

<h4 id="csiro--sagi-northdaf-australia">CSIRO &amp; SAGI-North/DAF, Australia</h4>
<p>Dr Joanne De Faveri is an applied statistician with interest in the application of statistical methods to agricultural research, especially plant breeding. She has worked most of her career in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries as a Biometrician in Far North Queensland working with Horticulture breeding programs such as strawberry, pineapple, macadamia, mango and citrus. More recently she joined CSIRO as part of SAGI-North, the Statistics for the Australian Grains Industry project, where she develops and applies statistical methods to GRDC funded grains projects.
She completed her PhD at the University of Adelaide in “Spatial and Temporal Modelling for Perennial Crop Variety Selection Trials” and has research interests in Linear Mixed Models, spatio-temporal modelling in field trials, statistical genetics and more recently statistics for High Throughput Phenomics (HTP).  Currently she is most interested in developing statistical methodology to best integrate HTP (including aerial image, sensor and hyperspectral) data into crop breeding programs for better variety predictions.
She enjoys the collaborative side of statistics in agriculture and applying new ideas to get the most out of research data.</p>
